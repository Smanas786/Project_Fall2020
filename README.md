## Topic
Cancer Detection with X-ray Images using Classification and integrating IoT
Devices with deep learning for real-time detection

## Abstract
With the advancement and exponential increase in usage of Internet-of-things (IoT) devices for enhanced user experience, the line between machine learning automation and integration of deep learning in IoT devices is also diminishing. These devices have enabled omnipresent access to the Internet and with it, the access of health care datasets and its techniques, thus adding the progress in cancer detection more accessible and significant. In this project, we try to detect the breast cancer cell (benign/malignant) using X-ray images gathered from the public datasets and training a model with the best accuracy for its detection. The second part of this project is to integrate this model in IoT devices for the submission of X-ray images in those devices thus making real-time binary classification of these images into two classes of either being benign or malignant.
